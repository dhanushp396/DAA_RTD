
We use hash functions to find the matching string. 

hash Function : 

h(n) = [value] % 11

As we learnt before also. Hash function we can make our own anything. value%7, (value+1)%13 .... After mod use a prime number for best results.

value = Sum of ASCII values of the characters in that string.
